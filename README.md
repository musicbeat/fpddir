The [stddata](https://github.com/musicbeat/stddata) is a trivial component in what could become a set of data supplying parts of a service to provide commonly used standards via a REST API.

 * interfaces: Loader, Server, Searcher
  * Methods: Load, Serve, Search
 * top-level types: LoadRequest, LoadResponse, SearchRequest, SearchResponse
